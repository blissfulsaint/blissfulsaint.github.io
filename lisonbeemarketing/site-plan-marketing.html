      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Have you ever been in a spot where you are trying to network and get clients for your advertising service but no one seems to know who you are or what you do? Maybe you’ve spent an entire day sending messages to cold leads because you can't fill your schedule with anything else? I can build a website that will drive traffic to you and eliminate the need to network on your own. In fact, your schedule will be too full with potential clients wanting to get on the phone with you because they want what your website promises to deliver.

      <h3>Audience</h3>

Our target audience may not be aware that YouTube ads is a viable method of scaling, or they may not know how to adequately use YouTube ads, in which case this website's job will be to get those coaches and consultants to schedule a meeting with Brandon Lisonbee and see how YouTube ad campaigns can help.</p>  <!-- change this -->

      <h3>Split-Testing Additional Proof and Sales Copy
        on Landing Page vs. Super Simple Page</h3>
      <p>
        Implementation:
        Many times, the simplest pages work
        extremely well for conversions, but not in
        all cases.
        In fact, some industries and verticals
        depend heavily on proof and further
        convincing.
        This depends on a few different factors
        such as:
        • Price point
        • Industry
        • Positioning
        • Competition
        • Funnel Type

        The only way to know is to
        test it.
        Run a split-test of 50/50 traffic to your
        opt-in page. One variation will be your optin
        page with the pre-headline, headline,
        subheadline, key bullets and a simple opt-in
        box or button.
        The other variation will be more evidencebased.
        It will have the same elements as the
        simple page, with additional proof elements
        such as testimonials, quotes, case studies
        and videos to show that the opt-in is real
        and produces results.
        Notes:
        You can use a tool such as www.useproof.
        com to easily embed proof into your pages
        and increase conversions.

      <h3>Optimize Your Upsell Price for the
        Highest Conversion Rate that Maximizes
        Your Backend Profit</h3>
      <p>
        Implementation:
        The typical upsell price is 2-3x the frontend
        offer price, but is that always the best
        case? Not necessarily.
        The core metric to be hyper-focused on is
        the CPA (Cost Per Acquisition) and AOV
        (Average Order Value) “spread”.
        AKA the difference between these two
        numbers.
        You should always be trying to maximize
        your AOV on Day 1 and lower your CPA
        over time to gradually increase the gap
        between AOV and CPA to maximize your
        liquidation. When done right, you can turn
        a profit on day one.

        There are two primary ways
        to test how your upsell pricing
        and flow will change the AOV
        of your funnel:
        • Simply do a 50-50 split of the
        one-time-offer upsell price
        (i.e. If it’s currently $297, test
        $197 or $497)
        • Put a lower-priced upsell in front
        of your higher-priced upsell and
        make it a no-brainer offer. Price
        this new upsell about 80% lower
        than your front-end offer.

        Notes:
        By placing a lower-priced product in Upsell 1 and making it a no-brainer, highly-congruent,
        irresistible offer, you’ll get a very high take-rate of that offer. In most cases, as it’s lower
        than what they’ve already invested, it becomes too hard to say no.
        This also enforces another subconscious “Yes” in their head, and therefore may also
        increase your conversion rate on your higher-priced upsell offer that follows.
